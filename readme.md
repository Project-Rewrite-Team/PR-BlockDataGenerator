# Auto Generator For Block Information
This project was created to make developing our mod easier, and I see no reason to not release it to the public! It's really simple to use, but let me go over the basics:

To start, you'll want to set a namespace using "setnamespace" or one of its aliases, then just run a command for "pillaredblock" and pass the name of your block and it will handle the rest!

*This program assumes a couple things, one of which being that your textures are always the exact same name as your blocks, and that the top texture for pillared blocks is always blockname_top. Keep this in mind when using the tool, or feel free to edit the source!*
